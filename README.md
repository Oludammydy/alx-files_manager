# FILES MANAGER

This project is a summary of my back-end trimester in ALX SE School encompassing topics like: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

<ol>
    <li>User authentication via a token</li>
    <li>List all files</li>
    <li>Upload a new file</li>
    <li>Change permission of a file</li>
    <li>View a file</li>
    <li>Generate thumbnails for images</li>
</ol>

I was guided step by step for building it, but I had some freedoms of implementation, splitted in more files etc… (utils folder was my friend)

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.

Happy Coding. Enjoy!

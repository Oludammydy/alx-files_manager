# FILES MANAGER

This project is a summary of my back-end trimester in ALX SE School encompassing topics like: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

<ol>
    <li>User authentication via a token</li>
    <li>List all files</li>
    <li>Upload a new file</li>
    <li>Change permission of a file</li>
    <li>View a file</li>
    <li></li>
</ol>

Generate thumbnails for images
You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc… (utils folder will be your friend)

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.

Enjoy!
